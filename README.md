# Dice-Simulater

A simple Python-based dice simulator that allows users to roll one or more dice and view the results in a visually appealing ASCII art format. The program also calculates and displays the total sum of the dice rolled.

Features:

1)Multiple Dice Rolls: Users can specify how many dice they want to roll at once.

2)ASCII Art Display: Each dice roll is displayed using detailed ASCII art that visually represents the result.

3)Total Calculation: The simulator calculates and displays the total sum of all the dice rolled.

4)Randomized Results: Each roll produces a truly random result using Python's random module.

How It Works:

1)The user inputs the number of dice they want to roll.

2)The program rolls the specified number of dice, each generating a random number between 1 and 6.

3)The results are displayed side by side using ASCII art.

4)The total of the rolled dice is calculated and displayed at the end.
